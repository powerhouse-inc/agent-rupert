# SS.00 Write a piece of flash fiction

Flash fiction is a very short story, typically under 500 words, that still contains the essential elements of a complete narrative: character, conflict, and resolution.

## SS.00.1 Choose a theme and setting

Select a simple theme (such as "missed opportunity", "unexpected discovery", or "small act of kindness") and a confined setting (like an elevator, bus stop, or coffee shop) that will keep your story focused and concise.

## SS.00.2 Create a protagonist with a clear want

Develop a main character who wants something specific in this moment. The want should be simple and achievable within the scope of your short story (e.g., to apologize to someone, to find a lost item, to overcome a small fear).

## SS.00.3 Write the opening that establishes character and conflict

Craft an opening paragraph (2-3 sentences) that immediately places your protagonist in the setting and hints at their want or the conflict they face. Start in the middle of action or thought to grab attention quickly.

## SS.00.4 Develop the middle with a turning point

Write 2-3 paragraphs that show your protagonist attempting to achieve their want, encountering an obstacle or complication, and reaching a turning point where they must make a choice or realization.

## SS.00.5 Create a satisfying ending

Write a concluding paragraph that resolves the conflict in some way - this doesn't mean everything needs to be tied up perfectly, but there should be a sense of completion or change from where the story began.

## SS.00.6 Review and polish the complete story

Read through your complete flash fiction piece, ensuring it stays under 500 words. Make any necessary edits for clarity, impact, and flow. The story should feel complete despite its brevity.

# FPM.02 Run the project and capture Vetra MCP endpoint

## FPM.02.1 Start the project and wait until it's ready

- Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__run_project` with the project name and switchboard URL from steps FPM.01 and FPM.02
- The project will start running `pnpm dev` in the background
- Wait for the command to be accepted
- Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__is_project_ready` repeatedly to check if the project is ready
- Poll every 2-3 seconds for up to 90 seconds
- The project is ready when Vetra Connect and Switchboard are both running. Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__get_project_status` to get the current status.
- Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__get_project_logs` to capture the startup logs

## FPM.02.2 Parse and verify the Fusion endpoint

From the logs, identify the Fusion URL, including its port.

Attach the fusion URL to the relevant task instructions or comments in your WBS.

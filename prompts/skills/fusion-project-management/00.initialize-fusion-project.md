# FPM.00 Initialize a new Fusion Project

## FPM.00.1 Inspect existing projects

- Use the `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__list_projects` tool to get all existing Fusion projects
- Note how many projects already exist in the system and what the project paths are
- Verify that NO project is currently in "running" state
- If a project is running, use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__shutdown_project` to stop it first

## FPM.00.2 Generate unique project name

- Create a suitable, descriptive project name in kebab case that reflects the package name, for example `acme-invoicing`
- If the name alreay exists, use the current date and time as suffix, e.g. `acme-invoicing-20260120-1635`
- The name must match pattern: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$/`

## FPM.00.3 Initialize the project

- Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__init_project` with the generated project name
- Wait for the initialization to complete
- Capture the project path returned by the tool
- Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__list_projects` to confirm the new project appears in the list and see its status

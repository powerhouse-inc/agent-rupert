# CFP.03 Stop the project

## CFP.03.1 Verify project is running

- Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__get_project_status` with the project name
- Confirm the project is currently in "running" state
- If not running, skip to the final status step

## CFP.03.2 Shutdown the project

- Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__shutdown_project` with the project name
- This will stop the Next.js service
- Wait for the shutdown command to complete
- Use `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__get_project_status` to confirm the project is now "stopped"
- Optionally get final logs with `mcp__fusion-prjmgr__get_project_logs`

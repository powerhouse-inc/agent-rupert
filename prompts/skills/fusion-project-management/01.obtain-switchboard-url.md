# FPM.01 Obtain a Switchboard URL for Fusion

Every Fusion project uses a Switchboard instance as its backend. You will therefore have to identify
the Switchboard URL _before_ running the Fusion project through `fusion-prjmgr`. If you fail to provide a 
Switchboard URL, or you provide the wrong one, the Fusion project will fetch the wrong data or fail to 
fetch any data at all.

## FPM.01.1 Consider which backend should be used

Review the context that is available to you to decide which backend should be used: 
- Did the stakeholder explicitly provide a Switchboard URL? 
- Did the stakeholder indicate which Switchboard instance should be used as back-end?
- If the stakholder didn't mention anything, are they indirectly expecting the Fusion 
  platform to display any data that is known to be in a particular Switchboard instance?

In terms of data, consider: 
- Which document models and documents will be needed
- If there are different environments available between which you need to choose: 
  development, staging, or production.

Based on these considerations, decide to use: 
- An existing Switchboard instance, potentially running in the cloud, with a public URL
- A local Reactor Package project's Switchboard instance that you may need to start yourself

## FPM.01.2 Start a Reactor Package project if needed

If the Switchboard instance will be an existing instance running in the cloud, this step can be skipped.

However, if a local Reactor Package should function as backend, you need to start the Reactor Package 
first, before starting the depending Fusion project.

Use the `reactor-prjmgr` MCP tool to ensure that the correct Reactor Package project is running and capture its endpoint.

Consult your capability scenario CRP.01 with the `self_reflection` MCP if needed for the details.

## FPM.01.3 Identify and verify the Switchboard URL

Ensure that you extracted the Switchboard URL in the required format: `http(s)://domainname[:port]/graphql`, 
for example `http://localhost:4001/graphql` or `https://switchboard.cloudhosting.tld/graphql`

Make sure to add the `/graphql` path if needed.

Attach the Switchboard URL to the task outcome and/or instructions to the relevant goals in your WBS.

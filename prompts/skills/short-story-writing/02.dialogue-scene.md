# SS.02 Write a dialogue-driven scene

Create a scene that relies primarily on dialogue to reveal character, advance plot, and create tension between two people.

## SS.02.1 Establish the situation and participants

Set up a scenario where two characters must have a conversation. Define who they are to each other (strangers, family, coworkers, old friends) and why they're talking now (confrontation, revelation, negotiation, reunion). Keep the setup simple and clear.

## SS.02.2 Create distinct character voices

Give each character a unique way of speaking. Consider their vocabulary, sentence length, use of slang or formality, and speech patterns. Write 3-4 lines of sample dialogue for each character that demonstrates their distinct voice.

## SS.02.3 Write the opening exchange

Craft the first 4-6 lines of dialogue that establish the tension or purpose of the conversation. Start in the middle of the conversation if possible, avoiding unnecessary pleasantries unless they serve to build tension.

## SS.02.4 Build tension through subtext

Continue the dialogue for another 8-10 exchanges where characters say one thing but mean another, or where what's NOT being said is as important as the words spoken. Use pauses, interruptions, and topic changes to create realistic flow.

## SS.02.5 Create a turning point in the conversation

Write a moment where the conversation shifts - a revelation, admission, ultimatum, or unexpected response that changes the dynamic between the characters. This should feel earned based on the tension you've built.

## SS.02.6 Conclude with changed dynamics

End the scene with 4-6 final lines of dialogue that show how the relationship or situation has changed from the beginning. The ending can be resolved or open-ended, but should feel different from where you started.

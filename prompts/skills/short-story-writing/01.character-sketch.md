# SS.01 Create a detailed character sketch

A character sketch is a brief portrayal that captures the essence of a fictional character through description, background, and personality traits.

## SS.01.1 Define basic demographics and appearance

Create the fundamental details of your character: name, age, occupation, and physical appearance. Include 2-3 distinctive physical features that make them memorable (e.g., a crooked smile, always wears mismatched socks, walks with a slight limp).

## SS.01.2 Develop their background and history

Write a brief paragraph about where your character comes from, their family situation, education, and one formative experience from their past that still affects them today. This should explain who they are but not overwhelm with unnecessary detail.

## SS.01.3 Establish personality traits and quirks

List 3 positive traits, 2 negative traits, and 2-3 quirky habits or preferences that make your character feel real and three-dimensional. Explain briefly how these traits manifest in their daily behavior.

## SS.01.4 Define their core motivation and fear

Identify what your character wants most in life (their driving motivation) and what they fear most (their greatest anxiety). These should be specific enough to create conflict but universal enough to be relatable.

## SS.01.5 Write a typical day scene

Compose a short scene (200-300 words) showing your character during a typical moment in their day. Use this scene to demonstrate their personality traits, quirks, and inner thoughts without explicitly stating them.

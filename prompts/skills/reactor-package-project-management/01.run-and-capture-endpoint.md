# CRP.01 Run the Reactor Package project and capture Vetra MCP endpoint

## CRP.01.1 Start the Reactor Package project and wait until it's ready

- Use `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__run_project` with the project name from step 01
- The project will start running `ph vetra --watch` in the background
- Wait for the command to be accepted
- Use `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__is_project_ready` repeatedly to check if the project is ready
- Poll every 2-3 seconds for up to 90 seconds
- The project is ready when Vetra Connect and Switchboard are both running. Use `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__get_project_status` to get the current status.
- Use `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__get_project_logs` to capture the startup logs

## CRP.01.2 Parse and verify the Vetra endpoints

From the logs, identify:
 - Vetra Studio port / URL
 - Vetra Switchboard port / URL
 - MCP endpoint URL

Once project is running, a new suite of MCP tools, `mcp__active-project-vetra__*`, will automatically become
available to you. Remember to use it later to create specification documents for document models, document 
editors, drive apps, and GraphQL subgraphs.

Test the `mcp__active-project-vetra__*` MCP tools now by getting the available drives in the new Vetra instance.
Notice there is a vetra drive` for the specification documents and a preview drive for testing out the document
models you will yourself create.

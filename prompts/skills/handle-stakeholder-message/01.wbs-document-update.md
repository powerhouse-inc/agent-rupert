# HSM.01 Review WBS and add task if needed

## HSM.01.1 Open and review your WBS document

- Use the agent-manager MCP tool to access the manager drive (ID: {{documents.driveId}})
- Open your WBS document (ID: {{documents.wbs.id}}) through the agent-manager tool
- Review the current goals and their status (TODO, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED, DONE)
- Check if any existing goals relate to the stakeholder's message
- Note any relevant deadlines or dependencies

## HSM.01.2 Determine if a new goal is needed

Based on your message categorization from HSM.00:
- If the message is an **acknowledgment only**, no WBS update is needed
- If the message is an **information request**, consider if gathering the information warrants a goal
- If the message is a **task request**, check if it's already covered by existing goals

## HSM.01.3 Create a new WBS goal if needed

For new task requests that require a WBS goal:
- Use the agent-manager MCP tool to update your WBS document
- Create a concise goal title that reflects the stakeholder's request
- Add the goal under the appropriate category in your WBS
- Set the initial status (typically TODO or IN PROGRESS)
- Add relevant details including:
  - Stakeholder name: {{stakeholder.name}}
  - Thread reference: Thread {{thread.id}}
  - Message reference: Message {{message.id}}
  - Expected deliverables
  - Any deadlines mentioned
- Save the updated WBS document through the agent-manager tool

## HSM.01.4 Update existing goals if applicable

If the message relates to existing goals:
- Use the agent-manager MCP tool to update the relevant goal in your WBS
- Update the goal status if needed (e.g., unblock if waiting for information)
- Add notes about the stakeholder's feedback or additional requirements
- Link the message reference for traceability
- Adjust priority or deadlines based on the message content
- Save the updated WBS document through the agent-manager tool

## HSM.01.5 Set appropriate goal status

Based on the message and your ability to proceed:
- **TODO**: Task is defined but not started
- **IN PROGRESS**: You can actively work on this task
- **BLOCKED**: You need clarification or are waiting for stakeholder input
- **DONE**: Task is complete (if the message confirms completion)

# HSM.01 Review WBS based on stakeholder request

## HSM.01.1 Open and review your WBS document

1. Use the agent-manager MCP tool to access the manager drive (ID: {{documents.driveId}})
   and open your WBS document (ID: {{documents.wbs.id}})

2. Check if any existing goals relate to the stakeholder's message

3. **CRITICAL** First review your own capabilities through the self-reflection tool.

   Refamiliarize yourself with the skills, scenarios and tasks you are capable of.
   
   Then consider how the intended goals you derived from the stakeholder request, should be 
   broken down to the level of scenarios and tasks you identified in your capabilities. Breaking 
   down goals into tasks you're capable of is the essence of planning!

## HSM.01.2 Add a new goal (hierarchy) only if needed

Based on your message categorization from HSM.00:
- If the message is an **acknowledgment only**, no WBS update is needed
- If the message is an **information request**, no WBS update is needed
- If the message is a **planning request**, check if it's already covered by existing goals

If you decide an update is needed, use the agent-manager MCP tool to update your WBS document.

**Create a new WBS goal (hierarchy) only if needed**

**Ensure that new goal(s) are broken down in skills, scenarios and tasks you took from your self-reflected capability.**

For stakeholder planning requests that require one or more WBS goals:

- Lay out the goal hierarchy with an optional stakeholder request goal at the top level, then broken down in subgoals 
  following the (1) skills, (2) scenarios and (3) tasks from your capabilities.

  Consequently, the deepest tree you can build is 4 levels deep: 
  (1 Stakeholder Request Group) > (Skill(s)) > (Scenario(s)) > (Task(s))
  
  However, for simple requests always consider more shallow hierarchies, always with 1 root node: 
  - Just (1 Skill) > (Scenario(s)) > (Task(s))
  - Just (1 Scenario) > (Task(s))
  - Or just (1 Task)

  You are not required to include every scenario of a skill, or every task of a scenario.

  You can also match and mix:
  (1 Stakeholder Request Group)
    > (Scenario) > (Task(s))
    > (Task)
    > (Skill) > (Scenario(s)) > (Task(s))
    > (Another Task)

  However, keep in mind that following the standard scenarios gives the most reliable results. Mixing too much brings risks.

  **ALWAYS** break it down the level of tasks though! And remember that tasks are executed in order, depth-first.

- Always generate a unique id for new goals. This can be a `{short-slug}-{suffix}` for readability, e.g. 'mktplan.1.5-287af5'

- Include stakeholder, thread ID and message ID as a comment, at least in the top level goal(s) you create, so you can find the converation again later when you're executing the task.

- **CRITICAL:** When creating a goal based on your self-reflected capabilities, ALWAYS fill out the instructions.workType and 
  instructions.workId with the corresponding value of the capability. If you don't get this right, your task planner won't be 
  able to formulate the right tasks for you later. 

  - For leaf goals mapped to a capability task use, for example: 
    `{ workType: 'TASK', workId: 'DM.01.1', comment: 'Consider only two user categories, customer and shop owner, per stakeholder request.' }`

  - For parent goals mapped to a capability scenarion use, for example: 
    `{ workType: 'SCENARIO', workId: 'DM.01' }`

  - For parent goals mapped to a capability skills, use, for example: 
    `{ workType: 'SKILL', workId: 'DM' or 'document-modelling' }`

  The values 'DM.01.1', 'DM.01', 'DM' or 'document-modelling' in the examples **MUST** be identical to the capabilities IDs and the types must match.

- Do include any specific details that are relevent from the original conversation as comment or context on the instructions. Think of it as sending a message to your future self.

- It is not a problem to add duplicate capability skills, scenarios, and/or tasks to your work breakdown as goals, if steps or procedures should be repeated. You can mix and match as long as the goals have unique IDs, and they reference the capability's workType and workId correctly. Consequently, duplicate instruction workIds 
  are totally fine. Duplicate goal IDs are not!

- Create short goal titles inspired by the capability but applied to the topic of the request,

  - For example, `DM.01.1 Start by listing the users who will use the new document model` becomes: `DM.01.1 - List Pizza Order document users`
  - For example, `DM.00 Check Prerequisites` becomes: `DM.00 - Check prerequisites for Pizza Order reactor module`
  - For example, `DM document-modelling` becomes: `DM - Pizza Order document modelling`

  - Try to keep the title length below 50 chars

- Always add goals and potential subgoals under the appropriate parent goal in your WBS

- Set the initial status (typically TODO or IN PROGRESS)

- Add relevant details including:
  - Stakeholder name: {{stakeholder.name}}
  - Thread reference: Thread {{thread.id}}
  - Message reference: Message {{message.id}}
  - Expected deliverables
  - Any specific requirements mentioned

### Self-check

- Before finishing the planning, double-check that all leaf nodes are of workType: TASK and if not, break them down further.

## HSM.01.3 Update existing goals only if needed

Based on your planning work so far, consider if further updates to the WBS are needed.

- **CRITICAL** Ensure that the goals are in the right order. The task planner will pick up tasks in the order they're listed in the WBS.

- Update goal statuses where needed (e.g., unblock if waiting for information)

- Consider adding notes about the stakeholder's feedback or additional requirements. 
  Don't use the notes for planning. Goals should be in the goal hierarchy itself.

- Consider linking the message reference for traceability

**IMPORTANT** 

Verify that all goals are broken down the level of capability tasks. Goals matched to scenarios and skills
without child goals will not get picked up by your task planner!

Based on the message and your ability to proceed:
- **Todo**: Task is defined but not started
- **InProgress**: You can actively work on this task
- **Blocked**: You need clarification or are waiting for stakeholder input
- **Done**: Task is complete (if the message confirms completion)
- **WontDo**: Stakeholder asked to cancel the goal

# HSM.01 Review WBS based on stakeholder request

## HSM.01.1 Open and review your WBS document

1. Use the agent-manager MCP tool to access the manager drive (ID: {{documents.driveId}})
   and open your WBS document (ID: {{documents.wbs.id}})

2. Check if any existing goals relate to the stakeholder's message

3. **CRITICAL** First review your own capabilities through the self-reflection tool.

   Refamiliarize yourself with the skills, scenarios and tasks you are capable of.
   
   Then consider how the intended goals you derived from the stakeholder request, should be 
   broken down to the level of scenarios and tasks you identified in your capabilities. Breaking 
   down goals into tasks you're capable of is the essence of planning!

## HSM.01.2 Add a new goal (hierarchy) only if needed

Based on your message categorization from HSM.00:
- If the message is an **acknowledgment only**, no WBS update is needed
- If the message is an **information request**, no WBS update is needed
- If the message is a **planning request**, check if it's already covered by existing goals

If you decide an update is needed, use the agent-manager MCP tool to update your WBS document.

**Create a new WBS goal (hierarchy) only if needed**

**Ensure that new goal(s) are broken down in scenarios and tasks you took from your self-reflected capability.**

For stakeholder planning requests that require one or more WBS goals:

- Lay out the goal hierarchy with the stakeholder request at the top level, broken down in subgoals following the 
  (1) skills, (2) scenarios and (3) tasks from your capabilities.

- Create short goal titles

  - For leaf goals mapped to a capability task use: `<task.id> - <task title applied to stakeholder request>`
    For example, `DM.01.1 Start by listing the users who will use the new document model` becomes: `DM.01.1 List Pizza Order document users`

  - For parent goals mapped to a capability scenarion use `<scenario.id> - <scenario title applied to stakeholder request>`
    For example, `DM.00 Check Prerequisites` becomes: `DM.00 Check prerequisites for Pizza Order reactor module`

  - For parent goals mapped to a capability skills, use `<skill.id> - <skill title applied to stakeholder request>`
    For example, `DM document-modelling` becomes: `DM. Pizza Order document modelling`

  - Try to keep the title length below 60 chars

- Always add goals and potential subgoals under the appropriate parent goal in your WBS

- Set the initial status (typically TODO or IN PROGRESS)

- Add relevant details including:
  - Stakeholder name: {{stakeholder.name}}
  - Thread reference: Thread {{thread.id}}
  - Message reference: Message {{message.id}}
  - Expected deliverables
  - Any specific requirements mentioned

## HSM.01.3 Update existing goals only if needed

Based on your planning work so far, consider if further updates to the WBS are needed.

- Consider moving goals in the right order
- Update goal statuses where needed (e.g., unblock if waiting for information)
- Consider adding notes about the stakeholder's feedback or additional requirements. 
  Don't use the notes for planning. Goals should be in the goal hierarchy itself.
- Consider linking the message reference for traceability

Based on the message and your ability to proceed:
- **Todo**: Task is defined but not started
- **InProgress**: You can actively work on this task
- **Blocked**: You need clarification or are waiting for stakeholder input
- **Done**: Task is complete (if the message confirms completion)
- **WontDo**: Stakeholder asked to cancel the goal

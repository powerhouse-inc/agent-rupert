# HSM.00 Categorize the stakeholder message

## HSM.00.1 Read and understand the message and its context

- Use the agent-manager MCP tool to access the manager drive (ID: {{documents.driveId}})

- Open your inbox document (ID: {{documents.inbox.id}}) through the agent-manager tool and 
  locate the thread with id: {{thread.id}} about "{{thread.topic}}"

- Review the conversation history to understand the context

- Now consider the new message content and identify the main and any secondary intents

## HSM.00.2 Categorize the message type

Determine if the message is:
- **Information request**: The stakeholder is asking for information, status updates, clarification, or explanations
- **Planning request**: The stakeholder is asking you to make a plan for future work, which you will keep track of in your WBS document
- **Both**: The message contains both information requests and planning requests
- **Acknowledgment only**: The message is just confirming receipt or thanking you (no action needed)

## HSM.00.3 Clearly state the tasks derived from the stakeholder request

For information requests, rephrase the request and consider which tools to use, if any, to fullfil the request. 
For planning requests, clearly state the intended goal(s) the stakeholder is targetting.

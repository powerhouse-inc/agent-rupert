# HSM.00 Categorize the stakeholder message

## HSM.00.1 Read and understand the message and its context

- Use the agent-manager MCP tool to access the manager drive (ID: {{documents.driveId}})

- Open your inbox document (ID: {{documents.inbox.id}}) through the agent-manager tool and 
  locate the thread with id: {{thread.id}} about "{{thread.topic}}"

- Review the conversation history to understand the context

- Now consider the new message content and identify the main and any secondary intents

## HSM.00.2 Categorize the message type

Determine if the message is:
- **Information request**: The stakeholder is asking for information, status updates, clarification, or explanations
- **Task request**: The stakeholder is asking you to perform an action, create something, or complete a deliverable
- **Both**: The message contains both information requests and task requests
- **Acknowledgment only**: The message is just confirming receipt or thanking you (no action needed)

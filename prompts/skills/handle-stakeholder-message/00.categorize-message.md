# HSM.00 Categorize the stakeholder message

## HSM.00.1 Read and understand the message

- Review the message content provided in the preamble
- Identify the main intent and any secondary intents
- Note any specific details, deadlines, or requirements mentioned
- Consider the tone and urgency of the message

## HSM.00.2 Check inbox for conversation context

- Use the agent-manager MCP tool to access the manager drive (ID: {{documents.driveId}})
- Open your inbox document (ID: {{documents.inbox.id}}) through the agent-manager tool
- Locate the thread with id: {{thread.id}} about "{{thread.topic}}"
- Review the entire conversation history to understand the context
- Note any previous commitments, agreements, or ongoing discussions
- Identify if this is a follow-up to a previous request or a new topic

## HSM.00.3 Categorize the message type

Determine if the message is:
- **Information request**: The stakeholder is asking for information, status updates, clarification, or explanations
- **Task request**: The stakeholder is asking you to perform an action, create something, or complete a deliverable
- **Both**: The message contains both information requests and task requests
- **Acknowledgment only**: The message is just confirming receipt or thanking you (no action needed)

## HSM.00.4 Identify specific action items

For information requests:
- List what specific information is being requested
- Note if you have this information readily available
- Identify if you need to research or gather data

For task requests:
- Clearly define what needs to be done
- Identify any dependencies or prerequisites
- Estimate the effort and timeline if possible
- Note if the task relates to existing WBS goals

## HSM.00.5 Document your analysis

Create a brief summary of:
- Message category (information/task/both/acknowledgment)
- Key points from the message
- Required actions
- Priority level (urgent/normal/low)
- Any blockers or clarifications needed

# CRP.03 Stop the project

## CRP.03.1 Verify project is running

- Use `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__get_project_status` with the project name
- Confirm the project is currently in "running" state
- If not running, skip to the final status step

## CRP.03.2 Shutdown the project

- Use `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__shutdown_project` with the project name
- This will stop both Vetra Connect and Switchboard services
- Wait for the shutdown command to complete

## CRP.03.3 Verify shutdown success

- Use `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__get_project_status` to confirm the project is now "stopped"
- Use `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__is_project_ready` to confirm it returns false
- Optionally get final logs with `mcp__reactor-prjmgr__get_project_logs`

## CRP.03.4 Return completion status

Return a JSON object confirming the entire skill execution:
```json
{
  "step": "stop-project",
  "status": "success",
  "project_name": "<project-name>",
  "project_status": "stopped",
  "shutdown_clean": true,
  "skill_complete": true
}
```

If shutdown fails:
```json
{
  "step": "stop-project",
  "status": "error",
  "project_name": "<project-name>",
  "error": "<error-message>",
  "project_status": "<status>"
}
```

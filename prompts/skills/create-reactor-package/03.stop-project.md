# CRP.03 Stop the project

## CRP.03.1 Verify project is running

- Use `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__get_project_status` with the project name
- Confirm the project is currently in "running" state
- If not running, skip to the final status step

## CRP.03.2 Shutdown the project

- Use `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__shutdown_project` with the project name
- This will stop both Vetra Connect and Switchboard services
- Wait for the shutdown command to complete

## CRP.03.3 Verify shutdown success

- Use `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__get_project_status` to confirm the project is now "stopped"
- Use `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__is_project_ready` to confirm it returns false
- Optionally get final logs with `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__get_project_logs`

## CRP.03.4 Return completion status

Return a JSON object confirming the entire skill execution:
```json
{
  "step": "stop-project",
  "status": "success",
  "project_name": "<project-name>",
  "project_status": "stopped",
  "shutdown_clean": true,
  "skill_complete": true
}
```

If shutdown fails:
```json
{
  "step": "stop-project",
  "status": "error",
  "project_name": "<project-name>",
  "error": "<error-message>",
  "project_status": "<status>"
}
```

## Summary

This completes the create-reactor-package skill. The project has been:
1. Created with a unique name
2. Started and verified to be running
3. MCP endpoint captured and returned
4. Cleanly shut down

The project remains in the projects directory for future use or can be manually deleted if needed.

# CRP.00 Verify system is ready for new project

Note on execution:
- This skill demonstrates automated creation and management of Reactor packages
- Ensure no other projects are running before creating a new one
- All outputs should be in JSON format for easy parsing and validation

## CRP.00.1 List existing projects

- Use the `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__list_projects` tool to get all existing projects
- Note how many projects already exist in the system
- Store the list for reference

## CRP.00.2 Check if any project is currently running

- For each existing project, use `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__get_project_status` to check its status
- Verify that NO project is currently in "running" state
- If a project is running, use `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__shutdown_project` to stop it first

## CRP.00.3 Get the projects directory

- Use the `mcp__reactor_prjmgr__get_projects_dir` tool to get the base directory
- This will be needed to verify project creation in later steps

## CRP.00.4 Return system status

Return a JSON object confirming the system is ready:
```json
{
  "step": "verify-ready",
  "status": "success",
  "existing_projects_count": <number>,
  "running_projects": [],
  "projects_directory": "<path>",
  "ready_for_creation": true
}
```

If a project had to be stopped, include that information:
```json
{
  "step": "verify-ready",
  "status": "success",
  "existing_projects_count": <number>,
  "stopped_project": "<project-name>",
  "running_projects": [],
  "projects_directory": "<path>",
  "ready_for_creation": true
}
```

=== BEGIN BRIEFING === 

# PREAMBLE

IMPORTANT:  Don't take any action yet. You will be guided through the tasks after 
            the briefing(s). Just process and confirm your understanding.

# Key Information

More specifically, you are about to be guided through the steps to process a new stakeholder message:

## Stakeholder 
The stakeholder that sent you a message
 - name: "{{stakeholder.name}}"

## Message Thread
The thread which contains the message
 - thread id: `{{thread.id}}`
 - topic: "{{thread.topic}}"

## Message
This is the message you need to reply to: 
 - message id: `{{message.id}}`

Content:
```message
{{message.content}}
```

# Notes

## Additional tools and context
 - Look inside your inbox to get the full context of the conversation.

 - Both your inbox and your WBS document are available in the manager drive
   and can be access with the agent-manager MCP tool

 - Whenever stakeholders refer to "your tasks", "on-going work", "current status", etc.,
   know that this implicitely applies to the goals in your WBS document, or smaller tasks
   associated with these goals.

## When and how to create new WBS goals
 
 - The WBS is a way to associate work requests with high-level goals, and break these down 
   into smaller goals (typically between 2 and 7 subgoals), all the way down to the level where 
   you can achieve the leaf goal by directly applying one of your MCP tools or skills.

 - DO NOT use WBS goals for small tasks that you can immediately take care of.

 - DO use WBS goals to capture big stakerholder requests for future reference and break them down
   into smaller subgoals to the point where you can easily achieve them. 

 - Use the self reflection MCP to learn more about the tools and skills you have available for resolving
   the WBS leaf goals. 

## Work documents
 - Agent manager drive ID: `{{documents.driveId}}`
 - Inbox document ID: `{{documents.inbox.id}}`
 - WBS document ID: `{{documents.wbs.id}}`

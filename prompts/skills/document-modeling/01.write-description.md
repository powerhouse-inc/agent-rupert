# DM.01 Write the document model description

Make extensive use of the `active-project-vetra` MCP tool for this scenario DM.01. 
Do not make any changes in the code yet!

## DM.01.1 Ensure the document model specification document exists in Vetra drive

- Check the Vetra drive to confirm if a preliminary document model specification 
  (formal type: `powerhouse/document-model`) already exists for the document model you
  want to create. 

- If it already exists, note the document ID in the task outcome

- If it does not exist already, create it first before proceeding
  - Make sure to set the name and add the document to the correct drive
  - After adding it, ensure you see the document model in the Vetra drive

## DM.01.2 Start by listing the users who will use the new document model

### Example

```
- Pizza Plaza restaurant owner
- Pizza Plaza customers
- Pizza Plaza kitchen chefs
```

## DM.01.3 Come up with a good, concise description

A good description includes its users, how they will use the document in a typical workflow, and it narrows 
its scope as much as possible by describing what will not be included.

### Example

```
The Pizza Plaza order document will be used by the restaurant owner, their customers and the kitchen chefs. 
The restaurant owner will prepare the document by defining the menu categories, options and prices in it. 
The customer will then use this menu to add the pizzas, sides and drinks they want to order to their basket. 
They will see the itemized prices and the total. Once the order is placed, a kitchen chef will check off the
items one by one as ready.

The order document does not support customization options for the items and it does not track the entire lifecycle
of payment, delivery, etc. It is meant to be a reliable reference for what the restaurant offers, what the customers 
wants, and what the kitchen has prepared.
```

### Restrictions 
- The description must not be longer than two or three paragraphs of text
- The scope of a document model should be "small" in the sense that the state of the documents it describes 
  should not contain more than a couple of kilobytes of JSON on average.
- The document model should be "simple" in the sense that it should focus on a single purpose and its business 
  logic should be precise and predictable: easy to implement and test.

### Wrap-up
- Add the description to the specification document in Vetra Studio drive.

## DM.01.4 Fill out the remaining header fields

### Document Type and Name

- The document type must be of the form `{organization}/{document-type-name}`
  - For example: `pizza-plaza/order`

- Make sure that the name is set in a human-readable, capitalized form
  - For example: `Pizza Plaza Order`
  - Make sure all extra spacing is removed and each word is capitalized
  - The name must match `/[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9 ]*/`. This is critical for the state schema later,
    which uses this name to derive the root type name.

### Document File Extension

- Reduce the document type to an abbreviation of 2 to 4 characters with a dot in front
- Avoid abbreviations with problematice connotations
- For example: `pizza-plaza/order` => `.ppo`
- For example: `software-engineering/xml` => `.sxml`, not `.sex`

### Author fields

- Fill out the author name with yours

- Fill out the website URL with the stakeholder's if you know it, or the package publisher's URL. 
  If both are unknown, use 'https://powerhouse.inc' as a default.

### Wrap-up
- Verify that all details are correctly written to the specification document in Vetra Studio drive.

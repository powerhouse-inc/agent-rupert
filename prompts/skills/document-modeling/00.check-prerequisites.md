# DM.00 Check the prerequisites for creating a document model

Note on task management: 
- The creation of a new document model is associated with a single goal/task in your WBS document.
- Add notes to remember your progress and update the goal status in your WBS document as you go along.

Note on communication: 
- Always communicate with the stakeholder through your inbox, in the appropriate messages thread.
- Don't hesitate to ask the stakeholder for clarification, feedback or confirmation if you are unsure 
  of how to proceed.
- If and only if you are waiting for a stakeholder reply, mark the WBS goal as BLOCKED until you can proceed.
  Then unblock the goal and move it back to In Progress.
- Notify the stakeholder regularly with status updates.

## DM.00.1 Ensure you have the required input and context

- Ensure you know who the stakeholder is who is requesting the new document model.
- Ensure you can contact the stakeholder through your inbox to ask questions and share updates.
- Ensure you have identified the WBS goal associated with the task. Create a new goal if needed.
- Rephrase the stakeholder request for clarity if needed.
- Ensure you know at least the informal name of the new document model and who the users are.
- Ensure that you know which Reactor Package project this document model will be in.

### Expected Task Outcome
The required input and context are available and the agent is ready to perform the next task.

## DM.00.2 Use the ReactorPackagesManager to run Vetra Connect and Switchboard

- List the available reactor package projects and confirm it includes the one you need
- Check which project is running, if any. If another project is running, shut it down first.
- Start the project you need if it's not running yet.
- Once the project is running, request the MCP endpoint from the ReactorPackageManager 
  and verify it's working.
- Request the Vetra drive from the ReactorPackageManager and verify you see it through the MCP endpoint.
- Verify that you see the accompanying preview drive too.

## DM.00.3 Review the existing package specs and implementation

- Review the specification documents in the Vetra drive and consider how the new document model 
  will fit in.
- Review the package implementation code in the project folder to get a good understanding of the
  existing functionality.
- Run the project unit tests and confirm that they are passing.
- Ensure that there are no pending previous changes. Commit outstanding changes if needed.

## DM.00.4 Consider updating the Reactor Package information

- Read the `powerhouse/package` document in the Vetra drive and check if the information is complete.
- Consider the potentially expanded package scope with the new document model that will be added. Consider 
  what an improved name, description, category, publisher + url and keywords could be.
- Decide if it's worth to update the information. Don't be too strict as you should not update the package 
  information often. If the existing data still fits the purpose, then leave it.
- If you decide to update the information, ask the stakeholder for confirmation first. 

### Expected Task Outcome
The Reactor Package information is up-to-date and reflects the expanded scope. 

## DM.00.5 Create the document model specification document if needed

- If the new document model specification document is not present in the Vetra drive yet, 
  create a new one to work with

## DM.00.6 Provide a stakeholder update

- Request the Vetra Connect, Switchboard and MCP endpoints from the ReactorPackageManager
- Notify the stakeholder that you started the document modeling task and summarize your task for them
  based on your considerations to this point
- Make sure to share the Connect, Switchboard and MCP endpoints with the stakeholder for them to follow along.

## Expected Scenario Outcome

All prerequisites are in place the agent to start writing the document model description.

# ED.00 Check the prerequisites for creating a document model

For this scenario, you will write TypeScript code in the active Reactor Package project directory that you can find through `reactor_pkgmgr` MCP tool.
    - Use the `reactor_pkgmgr` MCP tool to (re)start Vetra Studio and Switchboard if needed.
    - Use the `reactor_pkgmgr` MCP tool to inspect the logs
    
Read the `AGENTS.md` in the project directory for best practices

Use the `active-project-vetra` MCP tool 
    - to access the Vetra drive and inspect the document model specification document
    - to access the preview drive and create test documents when appropriate

Do not run the `ph vetra` or `ph generate` commands for anything, instead use the `reactor_pkgmgr` MCP tool

Code is regenerated automatically by Vetra.
    - Review bugs and errors in the GraphQL types if the code generator is stuck
    - Review and update the document model specification in the Vetra drive to fix type errors in the generated code
    - Consider restarting the project (/ the Vetra service) through the `reactor_pkgmgr` tool if needed

## ED.00.1 Familiarize yourself with the document model

- Read the document model specifications in the Vetra drive for context
- In the `./src/document-models` folder, confirm you see the types and code for reducers and explore their functionality
- Run `pnpm test` to verify all tests are passing
- Run `pnpm build` to detect type errors

Fix any issues you may detect

## ED.00.2 Ensure the editor specification document exists in Vetra Drive

- Check the Vetra drive to confirm if a preliminary document editor specification 
  (formal type: `powerhouse/document-editor`) already exists for the document model you
  want to create it for. 

- If it already exists, note the document ID in the task outcome

- If it does not exist already, create it first before proceeding
  - Remember: When creating _any_ document in a drive, including this, NEVER set the document ID manually. They're auto-generated by 'createDocument'.
  - Make sure to set the name and add the document to the correct drive
  - After adding it, ensure you see the document model in the Vetra drive

## ED.00.3 Confirm the document type and editor name

- Use `ADD_DOCUMENT_TYPE` to add support for your document type to the editor
- Use `SET_EDITOR_NAME` to set the editor name as it will appear in the code base
- Confirm the document type and editor name by setting the editor status (`SET_EDITOR_STATUS`) to "CONFIRMED"

## ED.00.4 Verify the code generation was triggered and boilerplate code was created

- Verify the editor boilerplate was created in ./editors/<editor-name>
- Explore the boilerplate code, which you can recognize by the usage of the <DocumentStateViewer> component
